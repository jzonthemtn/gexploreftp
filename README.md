# gExploreFTP

This Windows application is an FTP sever that proxies access to Google Docs. It allows you to access Google Docs via your favorite FTP client. Note that this project has not been updated in awhile and I'm not sure of its current status given Google's change from Google Docs to Google Drive. If anyone would like to provide updates please open a pull request and I'll happily merge them.

gExploreFTP builds on a [C# FTP Server](http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_network/sockets/article.php/c7409/A-C-FTP-Server.htm).

## Requirements

Requires the [ESENT Managed Interface](http://managedesent.codeplex.com/) to build. The runtimes are included in the References directory.
